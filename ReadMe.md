About
=============
This library grabs and parses Schema.org into a structured array.
If you're looking for a library that can help developers work with Schema in php, checkout out
https://github.com/spatie/schema-org as it includes goodies and shortcuts for working with schema 
within your IDE. This repo does NOT include the actual schema.org json - it will download it from 
https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/tree/master/data/releases on demand.

Cache/Storage of the resulting structured tree should be handled by your application. 
This library downloads and parses the json data into a structured array 
with some object normalization - nothing more.  


Install
=======
```php
composer require melting-server\schema-dot-org-tree
```

Usage
========
Initialize:
```php
include('./vendor/autoload.php');
use \schemaDotOrgTree\Tree;
```

Structured Schema Tree
------------------------------------
Download a version of schema.org and process it into a structure:
```php
//For the latest schema.org (default):
$tree = new Tree(); 

//For "all" of the latest schemas:
$tree = new Tree('5.0-all');

//For a specific version:
$tree = new Tree('3.7-core');
```

You can now access the structured tree:
```php
var_dump($tree->getTree()); //Structured tree 
```

Entities
------------------------------------
Get an entity:
```php
$entity = $tree->getEntity("http://schema.org/Thing");
```

Entities can have a parent Entity and may have children Entities:
```php
$parent = $entity->getParent(); // returns Entity or null
$children = $entity->getChildren(); // returns Entity[] (the array might be empty)
```

You can test to see if an Entity exists anywhere in the tree:
```php
$tree->isLocatable("http://schema.org/Thing");
```

Entities provide these public properties 
(not to be confused with the Entity's Schema Properties):
```php
// The Entity Property            The schema.org "field"
public $id;                    // from "@id"
public $type;                  // from "@type"
public $supersededBy;          // from "http://schema.org/supersededBy"
public $comment;               // from "rdfs:comment"
public $label;                 // from "rdfs:label"
public $subClassOf;            // from "rdfs:subClassOf"
public $purlSource;            // from "http://purl.org/dc/terms/source"
public $owlEquivalentProperty; // from "http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#equivalentClass"
public $category;              // from "http://schema.org/category"
public $closeMatch;            // from "http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#closeMatch"

/** @var string $version */
public $version;

/** @var Entity[] */
public $children = [];

/** @var Property[] */
public $properties = [];
```


Properties
------------------------------------
Get an entity's properties
```php
$properties = $entity->getProperties();      //with inherited properties
$properties = $entity->getProperties(false); //without inherited properties
```

Properties provide these public properties
```php
// The Entity Property            The schema.org "field"
public $id;                       // from @id
public $type;                     // from @type
public $domainIncludes = [];      // from http://schema.org/domainIncludes
public $rangeIncludes = [];       // from http://schema.org/rangeIncludes
public $comment = "";             // from rdfs:comment
public $label = "";               // from rdfs:label
public $purlSource;               // from http://purl.org/dc/terms/source
public $owlEquivalentProperty;    // from http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#equivalentProperty
public $subPropertyOf;            // from rdfs:subPropertyOf
public $category;                 // from http://schema.org/category
public $inverseOf;                // from http://schema.org/inverseOf
public $supersededBy;             // from http://schema.org/supersededBy

/** @var string */
public $version;

/** @var bool */
public $inherited; 
```

Advanced Usage
============================
Most developers should probably not need these things, but you're your own person.

Reader Data
----------------------------
Access the underlying json data from schema.org via 
```php
$tree->reader->getJson();
```


Multiple Version Support
------------------------------------
You can get a list of the available versions with:
```php
$tree->reader::VERSIONS
```

Currently supported versions:
 - '3.1-core' => 'https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/raw/master/data/releases/3.1/schema.jsonld',
 - '3.1-all' => 'https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/raw/master/data/releases/3.1/all-layers.jsonld',
 - '3.2-core' => 'https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/raw/master/data/releases/3.2/schema.jsonld',

 - '3.8-core' => 'https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/raw/master/data/releases/3.8/schema.jsonld',
 - '3.8-all' => 'https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/raw/master/data/releases/3.8/all-layers.jsonld',
 - '3.9-core' => 'https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/raw/master/data/releases/3.9/schema.jsonld',
 - '4.0-all' => 'https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/raw/master/data/releases/4.0/all-layers.jsonld',
 - '4.0-core' => 'https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/raw/master/data/releases/4.0/schema.jsonld',
 - '5.0-all' => 'https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/raw/master/data/releases/5.0/all-layers.jsonld',
 - '5.0-core' => 'https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/raw/master/data/releases/5.0/schema.jsonld',

```

With multiple trees in memory, you can retrieve specfic entities from specific versions.
```php
$tree->getEntityReference('latest', 'http://schema.org/Thing');
```

Each class/property/dataType is loaded with knowledge about which version from which it was loaded.
```php
$entity->version;
```

Limitations
===============
Schema is designed to be extendable and is intentionally not a "universal schema" in that it was not
created to cover all possible types of nouns and adjectives in existence. Rather, it tries to be vague enough 
that separate entities are only created when it would be useful to help a system's deeper understanding 
of a subject or its relationship to other subjects. This flexibility has allowed schema to be a strong
definition but also allows it be weird (i.e. Volcanoes have fax numbers). When implementing schema, 
you'll need to decide how strict you will be in its implementation. I have made a few decisions to aid
in the speed of processing versus completeness. 

The most important limitation of this library is single-inheritance. A sports arena, for example, is both 
a civic structure and a sporting location. These instances are uncommon in schema-core (more consequential 
when using the entire schema scope) but do occur. This library picks the first parent listed and ignores
the others. The purpose of this library is to represent Schema in a php array as a tree which does not
support multiple-inheritance. If this preference seriously messes up the meaning of an entity, shoot me 
message. From the instances I've seen in 5.0-core, there is nothing substantially lost.
